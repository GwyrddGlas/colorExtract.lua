# colorExtract.lua
A small library for [löve](https://love2d.org/) that extracts color palettes from images by *means* of [K-Means Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)

The demo requires löve 11.4 (Probably works in any 11.*). It comes with several demo images from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). Press space to cycle between them.
You can also drag and drop any .png or .jpg on the window and it will load. Keep in mind large images might get a little slow.

Here's some examples.
